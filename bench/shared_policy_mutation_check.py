"""Mutation check: revert each shared-policy fix and require the suite to catch it.

Every entry here is a defect an independent review actually found in this feature — two
data-corruption regressions in copy_agent and share_agent, an unconstrained policy path, and
several ways check_policies lied or crashed. Reverting any one of them must fail the suite;
a fix with no failing test is not a fix.

Run directly, or as a CI step. Restores every touched file on all paths.

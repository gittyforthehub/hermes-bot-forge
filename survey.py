"""Where a new Bot fits in the workspace it was born into.

A Bot arrives knowing its own job and nothing about the place it landed, so the first thing a user
has to do is explain their own machine to it — which repo holds the content, which Bot already
covers this, what is already scheduled. This reads that once, scores it against the Bot's own
directives, and writes the answer into the Bot's memory, so the Bot knows on turn one and never
runs the research again.

Three rules hold it in place:

* **Read-only and shallow.** Directory names, git remotes, the head of a README / AGENTS.md /
  CLAUDE.md, a package.json's name and description. Never source files, never deeper than
  `MAX_DEPTH`, never inside `SKIP_DIRS`, and never past `BUDGET_SECONDS`.
* **Indexed once, shared by every Bot.** The scan is cached under the Hermes root and reused until
  a root's mtime moves, so the tenth Bot costs nothing.
* **Deterministic.** Scoring is word overlap against the Bot's job — the same mechanic
  `forge.suggest_connectors` already uses for the MCP catalog. No model call, no tokens, no
  second opinion to wait for.

Nothing here writes outside the Bot's own profile, and everything that reaches memory is
secret-scanned first.

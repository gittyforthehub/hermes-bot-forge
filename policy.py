"""Shared operating policy: write once, every Bot picks it up.

The problem this solves is copy drift. `create_agent` writes each Bot's `SOUL.md` as a
literal file, so a rule that applies to every Bot — spend nothing without asking, never
push to main, don't paste secrets — has to be pasted into each one. The moment a Bot is
rebuilt, updated, or copied, the copies differ, and nothing notices.

`steipete/agent-scripts` solves the same problem for Claude Code and Codex: one canonical
`AGENTS.MD`, symlinked into each agent's expected filename, with a pointer-style line in
downstream repos. That pattern is borrowed here, adapted for two facts about Hermes that
make the naive version wrong:

1. **A whole-file symlink is wrong.** `ensure_identity()` writes the Bot's own name and
   profile id into the first lines of `SOUL.md`. One canonical file symlinked into every
   profile would give every Bot the same identity — they would each introduce themselves
   as whichever Bot was built first. Verified, not assumed: the identity line is required
   to be unique per Bot.
2. **A pointer line is also wrong.** Hermes reads `SOUL.md` straight into the system
   prompt (`prompt_builder._read_context_file`, which follows symlinks and reads through
   them). A line saying "READ ~/policy/AGENTS.MD BEFORE ANYTHING" puts the *instruction* in
   the prompt and the *policy* wherever the agent decides to go look. It follows only if
   the agent chooses to read it — which is exactly the case that matters least, because
   the agent already has everything else.

So the shared policy is **inlined at build time and kept honest by a fingerprint**. The Bot
gets the full text in its own `SOUL.md` (correct prompt semantics, unique identity, no
runtime dependency), and forge records what it injected. `check_policies` then reports any
Bot whose shared block has drifted from the canonical file — the drift becomes visible
instead of silent.

Hermes does follow symlinks when it reads context files (verified against
`prompt_builder._read_context_file` and `context_file_sources`, including the broken-link and
self-referential-loop cases, both of which degrade to empty content rather than hanging). That
is why a symlinked SOUL.md *would* work mechanically — and it is still the wrong default, for
the two reasons above. There is no opt-in symlink mode; inlining is the only mechanism.

## Money and external state

- Ask before spending money, buying anything, or opening a paid service — including a free
  trial that will charge later.
- Ask before publishing, sending, or posting anywhere a real person will see it.
- Ask before deleting data, and never delete anything you did not create this session.

## Secrets and privacy

- Never print, log, commit, or paste a secret value, even one that "looks harmless".
  Reference secrets by name.
- Read local data from disk before reaching for an API key or a network fetch.
- Send nothing private to a public audience or external service without approval of both
  the content and the destination.

## Honesty

- Report what you verified and what you did not. "Probably works" and "I could not check"
  are both useful; a confident claim you cannot support is not.
- A missing or skipped check is a finding, not a footnote. Say it plainly.
- If blocked, say what is missing and what would unblock it — do not quietly narrow the
  task to something you can finish.
- Prefer an unmeasured statement over an invented number.

## Working style

- Do the task asked. If a different approach seems better, do the asked task, then say
  what you would change and why.
- Read the project's own instructions and code before inventing a method.
- Make the change, verify it with the project's real checks, and report the real output.
- Prefer deleting an old path over layering a new one beside it.
- Leave the working tree as you found it, apart from what you were asked to change.

## Scope

- Ask before anything that spends, publishes, leaves this machine, or is hard to undo.
  Otherwise act, and report what you did.
